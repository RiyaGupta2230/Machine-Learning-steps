# Machine Learning Steps

This repository contains a set of classroom labs and example datasets for introductory machine learning exercises.

Contents
- `Lab1.ipynb` .. `Lab6.ipynb` — Jupyter notebooks with lab exercises.
- `All_classifiers.ipynb` — Notebook comparing classifiers.
- `Iris.csv`, `advertising.csv` — Example datasets used by the notebooks.

Quick start
1. Install dependencies (recommended): Python 3.8+ with `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, and `jupyter`.
2. From the repository root, launch Jupyter:

   jupyter notebook

3. Open any `*.ipynb` file and run the cells.

Notes
- The notebooks may generate output and checkpoint files; consider adding a `.gitignore` to exclude `.ipynb_checkpoints/` and large data files if you add more datasets.
- This repo was pushed to: https://github.com/RiyaGupta2230/Machine-Learning-steps

If you'd like, I can add a `.gitignore` and a short environment `requirements.txt` next.
